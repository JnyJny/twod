# API Reference

This section contains the complete API documentation for all twod classes and modules.

## Core Classes

### Point Classes
- **Point** - Traditional float-based 2D point with comprehensive geometric operations
- **CPoint** - Complex number-based point implementation with similar API

### Rectangle Classes
- **Rect** - Traditional rectangle using Point internally
- **CRect** - Complex number-based rectangle using CPoint and mixins

### Additional Primitives
- **Line** - Line segment with geometric operations
- **Ellipse** - Ellipse with mathematical properties

## Supporting Modules

- **Constants** - Geometric constants and enumerations
- **Exceptions** - Custom exception classes

## Usage Notes

All classes support:

- **Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- **Comparison Operations**: Equality, inequality
- **Geometric Operations**: Distance, angles, relationships
- **Conversion Methods**: Between coordinate systems and representations

The API is designed to be intuitive and consistent across all classes, with comprehensive docstrings and type hints throughout.
